### SDK for Node.JS 1.36 - February 2018

---

**3-Release SDK Breaking Changes**

-   None.

**API Breaking Changes**

-   Due to optimizations added on the service Channels, the **Rainbow SDK Node.JS 1.35 and prior will not be able to manage channels anymore starting Rainbow 1.36**. You need to update to this version to use this service. Note: Channels APIs are still in _beta_, the deprecation policy doesn't apply here.

-   To increase the scalability of the Channels API, the server will no more return the list of participants when retrieving information on a channel. Channel's property `users` has been replaced by `users_count` which contains the number of users of the channel. Existing API `fetchChannelUsers()` has to be used to retrieve the list of users in a channel.

-   In order to have an homogeneous way of working, the following API `getContactByLoginEmail()`, `getContactById()`, `getContactsByJid()` now return the contact found directly and `null` if not found. API `getContactByLoginEmail()` will no more return a JavaScript `Array` object when the contact was not found locally. API `getContactById()`, `getContactsByJid()` will no more return an error (catch) when the contact is not found.

**API Changes**

-   New API `getMessagesFromChannel()` has been added to retrieve all available messages from a channel.

-   Number of messages archived for a channel has changed from **30** to **100**.

-   New API `sendMessageToContact()` and `sendMessageToBubble()` have been added to send message by passing the `contact` object instance or the `bubble` object instance.

**Others Changes**

-   A fix has been done to close properly the XMPP connection when calling the method `stop()` from the SDK.

-   API documentation for `connectedUser` property has been fixed.

-   Avoid crash when calling API `signout()` when not logged-in.

-   Avoid crash when evaluating XMPP connection error.

-   Avoid crash on network lost and try to reconnect. Application needs to listen the event `rainbow_onerror`. This event is triggered when the SDK fails to reconnect automatically. In that case, the application has to manually call the API `stop()` and `start()` to be able to try to reconnect to the SDK.

-   When trying to reconnect to Rainbow REST APIs, the SDK for Node.JS will now made up to **50** attempts instead of 30 and the max time between 2 attempts has been set to **60s** as for the XMPP part.

-   Fix a crash when retrieving the list of bubbles.

### SDK for Node.JS 1.35 - January 2018
