## Development Kit

---

The Rainbow SDK for Node.JS contains:

- A JavaScript node.js module: This module has to be included in your application.

- Several starter kit applications to demonstrate how to use the SDK for Node library.

- An API documentation that describes the available APIs (that you can call from your application) and that contains some tutorials explaining the fundamentals parts.

### Node.JS SDK module

The Node.JS SDK is available either from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rainbow-node-sdk) or via [Github](https://github.com/Rainbow-CPaaS/StarterKit-SDKNodeJS). See the [Getting Started](/doc/sdk/node/guides/Getting_Started) guide to understand how to load it.
