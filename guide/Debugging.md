## Debugging
---

### Preamble
---

As the SDK for Node.JS is embedded into your Node.JS application and runs as a Node.JS process, it is interesting to know how to get information in case of failure.

This guide will describe in details how to configure the SDK for Node.JS in order to help you understanding what's wrong.


### Retrieving SDK version
---

If you need the information, at any time, you can retrieve the SDK Node.JS version by calling the API `version`. It's a public property accessible from the root object.

```js

let version = rainbowSDK.version;

```

Note: This information is displayed in logs.


### Configuring logs
---

The SDK for Node.JS lets you configuring how you want to get the logs. You can define to have access to logs from the console, from a file or from both.


#### Console logger
---

##### Activate - deactivate logger
---

By default, the Rainbow SDK for Node.js logs to the shell console used (ie. the shell console that starts the Node.js process).

You can disable it by setting the parameter `enableConsoleLogs` to `false`.
You can add a custom label added in logs (helpful when multiple instances of sdk are running)

```js

...
logs: {
    enableConsoleLogs: false,
    customLabel: 'Vincent02'            
    ...
}

```

When using the console logger, all logs are displayed. There is no way to filter messages.


##### Colors
---

Starting the SDK for Node.JS 1.43, you can add the parameter `color` to your console `logs` section in order for the console logger to write messages using different colors.

```js

...
logs: {
    "color": true,
    "enableConsoleLogs": true,
    ...
}

```

By default, console logger is configured with `color:false`.

##### Activate - debug network
---

By default, the Rainbow SDK for Node.JS don't log informations about the network, and informations which does not complain the GPRD.

```js

You can activate the log of full logs by setting the parameter `internals` to `true`. (`false` by default).
You can activate the log of http request by setting the parameter `http` to `true`. (`false` by default).

...
"logs": {
        "system-dev": {
            "internals": true,
             "http": true
        }, 
},

```


#### Files logger
---

##### Activate - deactivate logger
---

By default, the Rainbow SDK for Node.JS don't log information to a file, only to the console logger.

You can activate the file logger by setting the parameter `enableFileLogs` to `true`. (`false` by default).

The file logger stores logs into separate files by using a rotating mechanism.


```js

...
logs: {
    enableFileLogs: true
    ...
}

```

##### Path and level
---

You can modify the path where the logs are saved, add a label in the file name and the log level by modifying the parameter `file` like the following:


```js

...
logs: {
    enableFileLogs: true,
    file: {
        path: '/var/tmp/mypath/',
        customFileName: 'vincent02',  
        level: 'error'
    }
}

```

The available log levels are: `error`, `warn`, `info` and `debug`


#### Disk usage
---

Starting SDK Node.JS version 1.43, new options can be added to the file logger to minimize the size of files:

- `zippedArchive`: Setting this parameter to `true` will zip the file once written on disk.

- `maxSize`: Setting this parameter will rectrict the size of each log file. This is the maximum size of the file after which it will rotate. This can be a number of bytes, or units of kb, mb, and gb. If using the units, add 'k', 'm', or 'g' as the suffix. The units need to directly follow the number. When not set, this value is `'10m'` which means that the maximum size of the file is 10 MB.

- `maxFiles`: Setting this parameter will restrict the number of files written on the disk. This is the maximum number of logs to keep. If not set, no logs will be removed. This can be a number of files or number of days. If using days, add 'd' as the suffix. When not set, this value is `10` which means that a maximum of 10 files are kept.


### Retrieving information in logs
---

Each line logged has the same format. Here is an exemple of a log

```shell

16:04:39 - info: CORE -  (constructor) SDK version: 1.28.0

```

The following information is contained:

| information | Example | Details |
|-------------|---------|:--------|
| **Time** | `16:04:39` | Time in seconds |
| **Level** | `info` | The log level of this log |
| **Service** | `CORE`| The SDK Services that generated this log |
| **Method** | `constructor`| The SDK method that generated this log |
| **Info** | SDK version: 1.28.0 | The log information |

The log information can contain a serialized JSON object when needed.


 ### Specific version information
 ---

 At the beginning of the logs, you will find interesting information that can help you understanding the version used and how to contact us in case of issues:

```

The SDK for Node.JS logs the SDK version and all Node.JS main component used.

When contacting the support, don't forget to add all these information. Copy/Pasting only the error seen is not suffisant. We need to know which version you are using.
